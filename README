GW Instek tools, Python remote control for GW Instek instruments
================================================================

These modules provide a Python-friendly interface to the particular dialect of
IEEE-488 spoken by GW Instek instruments.

They depend on the operating system providing a character device for the
instrument link - /dev/ttyACM0 or similar on modern Linux installations (no
additional drivers are usually necessary). 

Currently functionality is limited to some rudimentary support for AFG-2000
series of arbitrary waveform generators. See examples/ for some common use
cases.
