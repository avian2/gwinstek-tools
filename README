GW Instek tools, Python remote control for GW Instek instruments
================================================================

These modules provide a Python-friendly interface to the particular dialect of
IEEE-488 spoken by GW Instek instruments.

They depend on the operating system providing a character device for the
instrument link - /dev/ttyACM0 or similar on modern Linux installations (no
additional drivers are usually necessary). 

Currently functionality is limited to some rudimentary support for AFG-2000
series of arbitrary waveform generators. See examples/ for some common use
cases. 


Installation
------------

To install run::

    python setup.py install


Known problems
--------------

Setting a positive DC offset with "SOURCE1:DCOFFSET n" with output enabled and
ARB sometimes inverts signal (e.g. 1 becomes the lowest voltage and -1 becomes
the highest). This can be fixed by setting the offset back to zero manually on
the front panel. It's best to avoid setting offset through USB.

Regardless of what the manual says, "SOURCE1:OUTPUT ON" is the correct command
to enable the output.
